I currently have two major goals for the next few months:
- Be in SF full time (I was there for 6 months and the [[My first 6 months in SF|city changed me forever]]).
- Work with a cracked team of insanely smart people on a world changing mission.

So why should you hire me?
- I'm a generalist, the archetypical T-shaped engineer. Give me a problem and I'll find a way to solve it. I think the horizontal stroke in the T is big enough, I would like to develop the vertical one and go really deep into an area at my next job.
- I have good product intuition - I can empathize with users and do the whole product cycle from drawing sketches to materializing a working product.
- I'm great at algorithms (I went to the [[My ICPC experience|ICPC]] twice!)
- I write beautiful code (can also write shitty code if the situation demands). I was big into compilers and functional programming (primarily [[I'm so glad I got into haskell|Haskell]]) during my undergrad. Vibe coders can spit out working code but software engineering for building a generational company requires writing beautiful long lasting code.
- I've led small short-lived cross functional teams at startups for projects that required quick iteration and delivery. I think people have always relied on me to get hard projects done that also require creativity/dealing with ambiguity.
- I'm fun! People [[experiments with people|love being around me]] and I bring great energy to any group. Being with the right set of people also sparks a lot of curiosity and creativity for me and it leads me to being so much more productive.
- I've done some [[Hard things I've done|hard things]]!

Why shouldn't you hire me? (aka things I'm trying to get better at)
- Mundane tasks can sometimes slow me down. I've found that quickly realizing that period of drag and talking out loud with a colleague about it gets me out of it.
- I can sometimes have off-sync schedule with the rest of the team. Days when I workout I'm able to manage this much better.
